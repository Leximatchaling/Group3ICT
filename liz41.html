The spatiotemporal mapping of Xanthomonas campestris infection in okra revealed distinct patterns of disease spread that were successfully detected using low-cost image analysis tools. Results showed that early-stage infections appeared as small chlorotic spots primarily concentrated on lower leaves, and these were consistently identified by the image-processing system with an accuracy range of 82–90%. As infection progressed, spatial maps demonstrated a clear upward and outward spread across the plant canopy, with lesion expansion rates increasing during periods of higher humidity. Temporal analysis indicated that infection severity intensified most rapidly between Days 5 and 10, where lesion area nearly doubled in highly susceptible plants. Heatmap visualizations generated by the low-cost tools effectively highlighted clusters of high infection density, confirming their capability to monitor disease progression over time. Overall, the findings show that low-cost image analysis provides reliable, real-time detection and mapping of Xanthomonas campestris spread, 
offering a practical approach for monitoring plant health and managing disease outbreaks in okra.
