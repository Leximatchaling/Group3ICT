<p>
An experimental design is employed using garlic, bread slices, and water. The procedure involves crushing garlic and mixing it with water to create a concentrated extract, which is then applied to the experimental bread slices. Both treated and untreated slices are stored in sealed containers to maintain a controlled environment. The samples are observed daily for seven days, with any mold growth being carefully documented.
