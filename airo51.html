<hr>

<p> To ensure the success of digital education, institutions should provide adequate technical support for both students and staff. Reliable IT assistance and functional hardware are essential to prevent technical glitches from disrupting the learning process. Additionally, teachers should use interactive online teaching strategies, such as live polls, breakout rooms, and gamified quizzes, to keep students engaged and motivated in a virtual environment. Finally, blended learning approaches should be considered as a long-term solution. </p>
