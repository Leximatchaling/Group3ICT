<h1>Methodology</h1>

<hr>

<p> This study will employ a comparative research design to systematically investigate the differences between the identified groups. By utilizing this framework, the research aims to uncover whether specific variables such as instructional methods or demographic factors result in statistically distinct outcomes. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, data will be triangulated through both academic records and student surveys. The academic records provide a high-level, objective view of performance, including metrics such as Grade Point Averages (GPA) and attendance rates. In contrast, the student surveys offer necessary context, capturing subjective insights into student attitudes, engagement levels, and perceived challenges that raw data alone cannot reveal. </p>
