This study investigates the UV-protective properties of Saluyot leaf extract 
for use in eco-friendly sunscreen. This research will examine how different 
amounts of Saluyot leaf extract can improve a sunscreen’s base ability to block 
UV light. The method includes preparing Saluyot leaf extract, adding a controlled 
amount of sunscreen base and then visually testing their UV blocking ability 
using UV-sensitive films. The goal of this research is to find the best amount of 
Saluyot extract that offers the most UV protection. This study aims to show 
Saluyot’s potential as a natural ingredient for safer and more environmentally 
friendly sunscreens, offering a plant-based solution for sun protection, an 
alternative to man-made chemical sunscreens.
