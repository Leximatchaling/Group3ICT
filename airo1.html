<p>This study aims to explore how college students use social media in terms of 
frequency, duration, and preferred platforms, as well as the various purposes for which 
these platforms are utilized, including academic, social, and entertainment-related activities. It seeks 
to understand students’ patterns of engagement with social media and how these patterns fit into their daily 
academic routines. By examining these usage behaviors, 
the research intends to provide a clearer picture of how deeply social media is integrated into students’ academic and personal lives.
