This study is designed to determine the antifungal efficacy of garlic (Allium sativum) extract against common bread mold. The research aims to compare the rate of mold growth between bread samples treated with the extract and those left untreated. Ultimately, the objective is to establish whether garlic can be utilized as a viable, natural antifungal agent for food preservation.
