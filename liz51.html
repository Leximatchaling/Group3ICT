<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that low-cost image analysis tools be further developed and integrated into routine crop monitoring systems for okra farmers, as they provide an accessible and efficient method for detecting early signs of Xanthomonas campestris infection. Future research should aim to improve the accuracy of these tools by incorporating higher-resolution imaging, multispectral data, or machine learning algorithms to enhance lesion detection and reduce misclassification. It is also advisable to validate the system across different environmental conditions, growing seasons, and okra varieties to ensure broader applicability. Extension programs may consider training farmers and agricultural technicians to use these tools for real-time field monitoring, allowing earlier intervention and better disease management. Additionally, combining image-based assessments with traditional laboratory diagnostics can lead to more comprehensive monitoring strategies. Finally, implementing a community-based reporting system supported by these tools may help track disease spread across larger farming areas, enabling faster response to outbreaks.
