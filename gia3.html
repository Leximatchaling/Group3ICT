<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
This study utilizes an experimental research design using materials such as Pechay seeds, soil, and containers. The process begins by soaking banana peels in water for 48 hours to create the compost tea. Two groups of plants are established: a control group treated with plain water and an experimental group treated with the compost tea twice a week. Growth is monitored over four weeks, with researchers using a ruler to measure height and manually counting leaves every week.
