Plants using leaf mulch are expected to demonstrate the highest moisture retention and the most vigorous growth. While plastic mulch may help with moisture, leaf mulch is anticipated to provide additional organic benefits as it decomposes, leading to healthier soil and better overall tomato plant performance compared to both the plastic mulch and the unmulched control group.
