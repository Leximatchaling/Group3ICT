<p>
Garlic extract should be further explored by the food industry as a potential natural preservative to reduce reliance on synthetic chemicals. It is recommended that future studies test different concentrations of the garlic extract to find the most effective ratio. Additionally, researchers may want to study other plant extracts, such as ginger or cinnamon, to compare their antifungal strengths.
