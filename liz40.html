The computational and mathematical analysis revealed clear hydrodynamic patterns influencing nest site selection of janitor fish in the Marikina River. Areas with moderate water velocity (0.15–0.35 m/s) showed the highest concentration of burrows, indicating that janitor fish prefer zones where flow is strong enough to supply oxygen but not strong enough to erode the nest. Shear stress modeling showed that burrow clusters were commonly found in regions with low to moderate shear stress, where sediment cohesion remained stable. Spatial mapping identified several riverbank sections with highly cohesive fine sediments, which aligned with observed nest densities. Temporal monitoring further showed that during higher-flow periods, some burrows exhibited partial collapse, while burrows located in low-shear refuges remained intact. Overall, the results suggest that janitor fish select nest sites in hydrodynamic “safe zones” characterized by stable sediments, predictable flow patterns, and minimal erosion risk.
