<hr>
<p>
Based on the findings, it is recommended that saluyot (Corchorus olitorius) leaf extract be further investigated as a natural prebiotic for digestive health. Longer-term studies with larger sample sizes and advanced microbiota analysis methods should be conducted to confirm its ability to enhance microbial diversity and promote beneficial bacteria. Future research may also explore its potential applications as a functional food or dietary supplement, supporting both public health and local agriculture by increasing demand for saluyot as a sustainable crop.
