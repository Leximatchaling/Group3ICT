The goal of this study is to understand how saluyot leaf extract affects the 
gut microbiota in rats to see if it can improve digestive health. The gut microbiota 
is a community of microbes essential for digestive health, and an imbalance can 
lead to digestive issues. Saluyot is a healthy vegetable rich in compounds that 
may act as prebiotics, food for good bacteria. While saluyot is known for its 
health benefits. This research will determine if saluyot extract can increase the 
diversity and number of beneficial bacteria and if these changes lead to improved 
digestive health. The findings will provide scientific evidence to support saluyot 
as a natural option for enhancing gut health.
