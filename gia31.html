<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The study follows a quasi-experimental design where tomato seedlings are divided into three groups: a control group with no mulch, an organic group using leaf mulch, and a synthetic group using plastic mulch. Over a five-week period, soil moisture levels are monitored and plant heights are measured weekly. All data is recorded and compared to determine the efficiency of each material in maintaining a healthy growing environment.
