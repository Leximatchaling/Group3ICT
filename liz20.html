<h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
<hr>
<p>
1.	How do hydrodynamic variables such as water velocity, shear stress, and turbulence mathematically correlate with the nest-site selection patterns of janitor fish in the Marikina River?<br>
2.	What is the spatial distribution of janitor fish burrows across selected river sections based on derived hydrodynamic and sediment-related measurements?<br>
3.	How do temporal changes in flow conditions affect sediment cohesion and the predicted structural stability of existing burrows using mathematical or simulation-based modeling?<br>
4.	What spatial or physical patterns such as zones of high scouring potential, clustering trends, or directional nest alignment can be identified through computational hydrodynamic 
mapping and geomorphological analysis?
