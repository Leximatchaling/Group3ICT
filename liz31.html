<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>

The study will be conducted with 6 trials using okra plants. No pesticides will be used to allow natural infection by Xanthomonas campestris. Each plant is labeled and a simple grid map will be used in mobile devices to track their positions. Photos of the plants will be taken every day from the top and front using a smartphone. Weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and rain, are also recorded to see if they affected the infection. A map of the plot will be created to show which plants were infected and how the disease spread over time. Daily changes in the infection size is used to determine how fast the infection developed. Hands and tools are cleaned before and 
after handling plants to avoid other factors in affecting the spread of the natural infection of Xanthomonas campestris.
