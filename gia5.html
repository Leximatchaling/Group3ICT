Based on the expected findings, it is recommended that home gardeners and small-scale farmers adopt banana peel compost tea as a cost-effective, eco-friendly fertilizer. Future researchers should consider extending the observation period beyond four weeks to see long-term effects. Additionally, further studies could compare banana peels with other organic waste materials to find the most potent natural fertilizer.
