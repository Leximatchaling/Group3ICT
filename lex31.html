<p>
The AURA-BEACON prototype will be built using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a TCS34725 color sensor, DFPlayer Mini audio module, microSD card, speaker, LED indicators, and a rechargeable LiPo battery. The Arduino will be programmed to detect specific LED hazard signals and immediately trigger corresponding pre-recorded audio alerts. The device will be tested under different lighting conditions and LED sources to evaluate detection accuracy, response time, audio clarity, and overall reliability in simulating real calamity scenarios.
