<p> The study expects to find that the way students use social media matters as much as how much time they spend on it. Excessive use for entertainment is likely to show a negative link with grades, often because it takes time away from studying and sleep. On the other hand, using social media in moderate amounts or for school-related purposes like joining study groups or sharing class resources—is expected to have a positive effect. This suggests that when social media is used as a tool for learning rather than just a distraction, it can actually help students succeed in their studies. </p>
