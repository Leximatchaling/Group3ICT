<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<hr>
<p>
It is recommended that farmers utilize leaf mulch as a sustainable and accessible farming practice to conserve water and improve crop yields. Further research should be conducted in actual field settings rather than containers to see if the results remain consistent. Additional studies could also include other organic options, such as straw or wood chips, to broaden the understanding of mulching benefits.
