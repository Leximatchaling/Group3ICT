<h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
<hr>
<p>
1. What concentration of Saluyot leaf extract provides the most effective UV-blocking ability when added to a standard sunscreen base?<br>

2. How does the UV-protective performance of Saluyot-enhanced sunscreen compare to that of a control sunscreen without plant extract?<br>

3. What role do flavonoids and other phytochemicals in Saluyot leaf extract play in absorbing or blocking UV radiation?<br>

4. Can Saluyot-based sunscreen formulations serve as a safer and more environmentally friendly alternative to conventional chemical sunscreens in terms of both efficacy and sustainability?
