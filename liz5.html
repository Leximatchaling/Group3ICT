<h1>Recommendations</h1>

<p>
Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that future research further explore the combined antimicrobial effects of 
garlic and acetic acid by testing a wider range of garlic concentrations and different contact times to determine the most effective 
treatment conditions. Additional studies may also analyze other structural forms of garlic, such as minced or powdered, to compare their efficiency 
with intact, sliced, and crushed samples. It is also advised that researchers investigate how storage temperature, pH variations, and fermentation stages 
of tuba vinegar influence the reduction of E. coli to better understand the interaction between natural organic acids and bioactive compounds in garlic. 
For practical applications, food handlers and local producers of tuba or similar fermented products may consider incorporating properly prepared garlic as a natural 
antimicrobial supplement, provided that its sensory impact is acceptable. Finally, further experiments using molecular or biochemical analysis are recommended to identify 
the specific compounds responsible for microbial reduction, which would deepen scientific understanding and support safer post-harvest handling practices.
