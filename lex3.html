<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Saluyot leaves will be dried, ground, and extracted to obtain active compounds. The extract will be mixed into a standard sunscreen base at varying concentrations (1 mL, 2 mL, 3 mL, and 5 mL), with a control sample. Each formulation will be applied to UV-sensitive films and exposed to UV light. The degree of color change will indicate UV-blocking effectiveness, helping identify the optimal concentration for natural sun protection.
