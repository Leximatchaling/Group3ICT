<h1>Results</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The study is expected to show that garlic (Allium sativum) demonstrates noticeable 
antibacterial activity against E. coli in tuba vinegar, with the effectiveness varying based on 
the structure of the garlic bulb. Crushed garlic is anticipated to produce the strongest antimicrobial 
effect due to the greater release of allicin, followed by sliced garlic, while intact are expected to show the 
weakest effect. Standardized acetic acid alone is also expected to reduce E. coli growth, confirming its known 
antibacterial properties. When garlic and acetic acid are combined, the treatment is expected to produce reduction of E. coli compared to either treatment applied individually, 
suggesting a possible cooperative effect. Overall, the results are expected to demonstrate that combining natural antibacterial agents particularly crushed garlic with acetic acid 
can significantly enhance the microbial safety of tuba vinegar under controlled post-harvest conditions.
