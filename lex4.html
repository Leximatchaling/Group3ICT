The visual tests showed that adding Saluyot (Corchorus olitorius) leaf extract to the sunscreen base improved its UV-blocking ability compared to the control sample. Films treated with higher concentrations of extract (particularly 3 mL and 5 mL) displayed noticeably less color change under UV exposure, indicating stronger protection. Lower concentrations (1 mL and 2 mL) provided moderate improvement but were less effective than higher doses. Overall, the findings suggest that increasing the amount of Saluyot extract enhances sunscreen performance, with 5 mL producing the most consistent UV protection among the tested formulations.
