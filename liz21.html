<h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
<hr>
<p>
1.	How can low-cost image analysis tools be used to detect and quantify Xanthomonas campestris infection in okra plants?<br>
2.	What is the spatial distribution of Xanthomonas campestris infection across the okra plot during the observation period?<br>
3.	How does the severity of infection change over time as observed through periodic image collection?<br>
4.	 What patterns of disease spread (hotspots, progression direction, or clustering) can be identified using spatiotemporal mapping?
