It is anticipated that the Pechay plants treated with the banana peel compost tea will exhibit superior growth compared to the control group. Because banana peels are naturally rich in potassium and other essential minerals, the treated plants are expected to grow significantly taller and develop a higher number of leaves, proving the tea's effectiveness as a liquid fertilizer.
