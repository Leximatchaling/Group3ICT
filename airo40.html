<h1>Results</h1>

<hr>

<p> The findings are expected to show that salary, work environment, and management support are the most important factors in determining how satisfied 
employees are with their jobs. A competitive salary provides financial security, while a positive work environment ensures that staff feel comfortable and motivated
throughout the day. Furthermore, strong support from management helps build trust and helps employees feel valued for their contributions. 
When these three areas are strong, overall job satisfaction tends to rise significantly.  </p>
