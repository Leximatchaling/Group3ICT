The primary goal of this study is to investigate the growth-enhancing potential of banana peel compost tea on Pechay (Brassica rapa). Specifically, it aims to measure the tea's impact on vertical plant height and the total number of leaves produced. Through these metrics, the study seeks to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the overall growth performance of plants treated with this organic solution.
