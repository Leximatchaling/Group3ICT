Testing of the AURA-BEACON prototype showed that the device successfully detected LED hazard signals and translated them into clear audio alerts in real time. Under varying lighting conditions, the color sensor consistently identified LED signals with high accuracy, while the DFPlayer Mini module provided immediate playback of pre-recorded warnings. The audio alerts were loud and distinct enough to be heard in noisy environments, and response times were fast, ensuring timely communication during simulated calamities. Overall, the system demonstrated reliable performance in enhancing accessibility and situational awareness, particularly for visually impaired individuals and vulnerable groups.
