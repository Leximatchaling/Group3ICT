<h1>Methodology</h1>

<hr>

<p> This study will employ a quantitative survey research design to systematically investigate the factors 
influencing employee experiences within the workplace. By utilizing a standardized job satisfaction questionnaire, 
the research ensures that data collection is consistent, objective, and replicable across diverse departments. This instrument is specifically designed to measure key dimensions such as 
work environment, compensation, and management support, providing a multifaceted view of the employee perspective. Once the data is gathered from the SME employees, it will be subjected 
to a rigorous statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics will be used 
to summarize the basic features of the dataset, providing a clear overview of general trends. </p>
