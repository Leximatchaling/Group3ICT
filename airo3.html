<h1>Methodology</h1>

<hr>

<p> This research will utilize a descriptive-correlational research design to examine the relationship between student 
experiences and their academic outcomes. The descriptive aspect of the study aims to accurately profile the current status of the participants, 
while the correlational component seeks to identify the strength and direction of the association between the variables without manipulating them. 
Data collection will be facilitated through a structured questionnaire specifically designed for the college student demographic, ensuring that all responses are standardized and 
measurable. </p>
