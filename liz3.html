<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>
This experiment utilized three forms of garlic—intact, sliced, and crushed—to determine how bulb structure influences 
the reduction of Escherichia coli when combined with standardized acetic acid in tuba vinegar. Equal masses of garlic were 
prepared under sterile conditions, and freshly collected tuba vinegar was filtered and adjusted to a consistent acetic acid 
concentration. A laboratory-prepared E. coli suspension with a known microbial load was introduced into separate containers of the vinegar, 
creating four treatment groups: intact garlic, sliced garlic, crushed garlic, and a vinegar-only control. Each garlic form was added to its
corresponding inoculated sample, and all treatments were maintained under controlled post-harvest conditions, including uniform temperature and 
sterile, airtight containers. Samples from each treatment were collected at predetermined contact times (30, 60, and 120 minutes) and were immediately 
subjected to microbial analysis. Surface plating on selective agar was conducted to quantify surviving E. coli through colony-forming unit (CFU) counts. 
Data from all treatments were compared to evaluate the effectiveness of each garlic bulb structure in enhancing the antimicrobial action of acetic acid in
tuba vinegar.
