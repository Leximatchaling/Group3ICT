The analysis of fecal samples showed that rats fed with saluyot leaf extract exhibited greater microbial diversity compared to the control group. Microscopic observations revealed an increase in beneficial bacterial forms, while pH measurements indicated a more balanced gut environment in the experimental group. These findings suggest that saluyot extract promoted the growth of healthy gut bacteria and improved overall microbial composition, supporting its potential role as a natural prebiotic for digestive health.
