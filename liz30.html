<h1>Methodology</h1>
<hr>
<p>
The study will be conducted with six measurement cycles along selected river sections known to contain (Pterygoplichthys) burrows. No physical disturbances 
will be introduced to ensure that natural hydrodynamic conditions and sediment characteristics are maintained throughout the investigation. Each burrow site and 
riverbank segment will be labeled using georeferenced markers, and a simple grid map will be loaded on mobile devices to track the exact positions of all observation points. 
Hydrodynamic measurements using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) including water velocity, shear stress, and turbulence will be taken using portable flow meters 
during each cycle, while sediment samples will be collected to assess moisture content and cohesion.
 Pictures of the burrow structures will be captured daily from angles to document changes in stability and burrow conditions. Environmental factors such as rainfall and water 
 level will also be recorded to determine whether these variables influence sediment stability and nest formation. Daily observations of changes in burrow integrity and surrounding 
 sediment will be used to assess how physical forces affect burrow persistence over time. All equipment is cleaned before and after fieldwork to avoid contamination of sediment samples 
 and ensure consistency across measurement cycles.
