<h1>Research objectives</h1>

<p>
The objective of this study is to develop and apply low-cost image analysis tools, such as smartphone imaging and open-source software, to detect the severity of Xanthomonas campestris infection in okra plants. Specifically, the study aims to generate spatial maps to illustrate the distribution of the infection across the okra plot using georeferenced images. Additionally, it seeks to monitor and analyze temporal changes in disease severity through periodic image collection, allowing for the assessment of how infection progresses over time. 
Finally, the research aims to identify and interpret disease-spread patterns, including hotspots, clustering, and directional progression, through the application of spatiotemporal mapping and visual analytics. By using these methods, the study will provide a practical and ow-cost approach.
