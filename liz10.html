The study aims to quantitatively analyze key hydrodynamic variables—such as water velocity, shear stress, and turbulence—to determine 
their effects on sediment cohesion and structural stability in river sections inhabited by janitor fish. It also seeks to measure and model spatial variations 
in these hydrodynamic forces using computational and mathematical methods to identify areas that support nest formation. Additionally, the research involves monitoring 
temporal changes in flow conditions and evaluating how these variations influence the structural integrity of existing burrows through periodic field measurements. Finally, the study 
intends to identify and interpret physical patterns, including zones of high scouring potential, cohesive sediment clusters, and flow-driven erosion pathways, 
through hydrodynamic mapping and geomorphological analysis to better understand how these physical processes shape the distribution of janitor fish nests.
