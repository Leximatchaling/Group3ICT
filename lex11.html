Effective communication of hazards during floods, earthquakes, and typhoons is 
important to minimize risks to human life. Current visual alerts, such as LED hazard 
signals, are often insufficient for individuals with visual impairments or in low-visibility 
conditions. To address this gap, this study proposes the development of AURA-BEACON, 
an Arduino-based unified reality audio beacon designed to translate LED hazard signals 
into real-time audio alerts. The device uses various environmental sensors to detect 
hazards such as rising water levels, smoke, heat, or vibrations and immediately triggers 
pre-recorded audio warnings. AURA-BEACON aims to enhance accessibility, situational awareness, and 
community responsiveness during calamities, supporting both vulnerable populations 
and disaster response personnel. The prototype will be tested under varying conditions 
to ensure accurate detection and clear audio playback. By combining visual and audio 
alerts, the system seeks to improve emergency response and provide a better foundation 
for more inclusive early-warning systems.
