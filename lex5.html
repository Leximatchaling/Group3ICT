<p>
Based on the findings, it is recommended that Saluyot (Corchorus olitorius) leaf extract be further explored as a natural additive in sunscreen formulations, particularly at higher concentrations where UV protection was most effective. Future studies should expand testing to include standardized SPF measurements, skin safety trials, and long-term stability assessments to validate its practical use. Researchers and cosmetic developers are encouraged to consider Saluyot as a sustainable alternative to chemical sunscreens, promoting eco-friendly skincare solutions that benefit both human health and the environment.
