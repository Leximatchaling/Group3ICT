<h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
<hr>
<p>
1.	What is the level of E. coli surface contamination in tuba vinegar before treatment with garlic and acetic acid?<br>
2.	Does the structure of garlic bulbs (intact, sliced, or crushed) significantly affect the reduction of E. coli in tuba vinegar?<br>
3.	How does the antibacterial effect of garlic alone compare to acetic acid alone in reducing E. coli contamination?<br>
4.	Is there a significant effect between garlic bulb structure and standardized acetic acid in reducing E. coli levels?
