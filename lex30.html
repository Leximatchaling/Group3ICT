<p>
This study will use black rats (Rattus rattus) divided into control and experimental groups over three days. The control group will receive a standard diet, while the experimental group will be given the same diet supplemented with saluyot leaf extract. Fecal samples will be collected at the start and end of the study, then analyzed using basic laboratory techniques such as microscopy and pH testing to observe changes in gut microbiota diversity and environment.
