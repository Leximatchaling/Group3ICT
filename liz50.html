<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Based on the findings, it is recommended that river management efforts prioritize the monitoring of hydrodynamic “hotspots,” particularly areas with moderate flow velocity and cohesive sediments, as these zones are most favorable for janitor fish nest formation. Targeted interventions—such as sediment disturbance, bank reinforcement, or controlled flow adjustments—may help reduce suitable nesting habitats and limit population expansion. Future studies should incorporate longer monitoring periods and wider river sections to capture seasonal changes in hydrodynamic conditions. It is also advisable to integrate biological data, such as fish behavior and population density, with hydrodynamic models for a more complete understanding of nest site selection. Finally, the use of advanced computational simulations and high-resolution mapping is encouraged to support more accurate prediction and management of janitor fish nesting patterns in urban river systems like the Marikina River.
