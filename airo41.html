<h1>Results</h1>

<hr>

<p> The study is expected to find that online learning is highly effective when it is backed by reliable technology and well-planned instructional strategies. When students have access to stable platforms and clear digital content, their ability to learn independently often thrives. However, the results are also likely to show that many students struggle with the limited personal interaction found in virtual classrooms, which can lead to feelings of isolation.   </p>
