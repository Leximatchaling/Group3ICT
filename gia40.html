The researchers expect that the bread treated with garlic extract will show a significant reduction or delay in mold growth. This is due to the presence of natural antifungal compounds in garlic, which are hypothesized to create an environment hostile to fungal spores, thereby extending the shelf life of the bread compared to the untreated control group.
