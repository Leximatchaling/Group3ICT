<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<hr>
<p>
It is recommended that the AURA-BEACON system be further refined and tested under real-world disaster scenarios to ensure maximum reliability and accessibility. Future improvements should focus on enhancing sensor sensitivity, reducing false triggers, and optimizing audio clarity in noisy environments. Expanding the device to support multiple languages and customizable alerts would also increase its usefulness for diverse communities. Collaboration with local disaster response agencies is encouraged to integrate AURA-BEACON into broader early-warning systems, ensuring that vulnerable populations such as the visually impaired and elderly receive timely, actionable hazard alerts during calamities.
