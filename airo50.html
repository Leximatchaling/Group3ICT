<p> To improve overall employee retention and morale, SME owners should prioritize improving compensation and benefits packages. Competitive pay is a fundamental motivator that ensures employees feel their time and skills are fairly valued. A supportive atmosphere reduces stress and makes the workplace more inviting. Finally, regular employee satisfaction assessments should be conducted to stay proactive. By consistently checking in through surveys or feedback sessions, owners can identify issues early and make data-driven changes to keep the workforce happy and productive. </p>
