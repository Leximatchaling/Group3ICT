<h1>Statement of the Problem</h1>
<hr>
<p>
1. How accurately can the AURA-BEACON detect and interpret different LED hazard signals under varying lighting conditions?<br>

2. What is the response time of the AURA-BEACON in translating LED hazard signals into audio alerts during simulated calamities?<br>

3. How clear and effective are the audio alerts produced by the AURA-BEACON in ensuring accessibility for visually impaired individuals and vulnerable populations?<br>

4. To what extent does the integration of audio alerts alongside LED signals improve community responsiveness and situational awareness during emergencies compared to LED-only systems?
