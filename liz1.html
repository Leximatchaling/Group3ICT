<h1>Research Objectives</h1>

This study aims to examine how the structural form of garlic (Allium sativum) influences its antibacterial effectiveness against Escherichia 
coli when combined with standardized acetic acid in tuba vinegar under controlled post-harvest conditions. The research establishes the level 
of E. coli contamination in tuba vinegar and to determine how varying garlic bulb structures such as intact, sliced, and crushed forms affect 
the extent of microbial reduction. Moreover, the study aims to compare the individual antibacterial effects of garlic and acetic acid to identify 
whether one is more effective when used alone. thereby offering a natural, enhanced approach for improving the microbial safety of tuba vinegar.
